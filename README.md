# IntroductionToRobotics

This is my repository that will contain all the assignments from the **"Introduction to Robotics"** laboratory at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, **University of Bucharest**. Each assignment will include detailed documentation, with images and videos.

# Homeworks

## Homework 1

This assignment focuses on controlling an RGB LED using three potentiometers (one for each color).



For the implementation, I used:

* An RGB LED
* 3 potentiometers
* 6 resistors of 100 ohms (I connected three in series for each because I only had one 330-ohm resistor)
* 1 resistor of 330 ohms

## Homework 2
This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using
LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino.

Components
* LEDs (At least 4: 3 for the floors and 1 for the elevatorâ€™s operational
state)
* Buttons
* Buzzer 
* Resistors and wires as needed

This code has functionalities only for the 1st and 3rd floor and has some bugs.The project's functionality is the one shown in the following video.: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kLPn3MB_2u4

Below is a photo with the assembled homework.

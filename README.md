## Homework 1

This assignment focuses on controlling an RGB LED using three potentiometers (one for each color).



For the implementation, I used:

* An RGB LED
* 3 potentiometers
* 6 resistors of 100 ohms (I connected three in series for each because I only had one 330-ohm resistor)
* 1 resistor of 330 ohms

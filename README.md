This assignment focuses on controlling an RGB LED using three potentiometers (one for each color).



For the implementation, I used:

* An RGB LED
* 3 potentiometers
* 6 resistors of 100 ohms (I connected three in series for each because I only had one 330-ohm resistor)
* 1 resistor of 330 ohms

<summary><h2> Homework 3</summary>
<br>
This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using
LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino.

Components
* LEDs (At least 4: 3 for the floors and 1 for the elevatorâ€™s operational
state)
* Buttons
* Buzzer 
* Resistors and wires as needed

This code has functionalities only for the 1st and 3rd floor and has some bugs.The project's functionality is the one shown in the following video.: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kLPn3MB_2u4

Below is a photo with the assembled homework.

<summary><h2> Homework 4</summary>
<br>
This project involves implementing a 7-segment display using Arduino, where you can 'draw' by lighting up segments one by one.

**General description:** We will use the joystick to control the position of the segment and 'draw' on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should transition from the current position only to neighboring segments, without passing through 'walls'.

**Components**:
* 7 segment display (1)
* 1 joystick
* resistors and wires

**Requirement**: The initial position should be on the DP. The current
position always blinks (irrespective of the fact that the segment is on or
off). Use the joystick to move from one position to neighbors (see table for
corresponding movement). Short pressing the button toggles the segment
state from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. Long pressing the button
resets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving the
current position to the decimal point.
